# 04 Performance Task 1: Security KPIs Analysis & Charting

* **Course Code**: IT2312 - IT Service Management
* **Term**: Midterm
* **Student Name**: Godwyn Neri
* **Assessment Task**: 04 Performance Task 1 (Total: 60 points)
* **Topic**: IT Service Management in Different Industries (ITSM Governance and Security)
* **Objective**: Formulate a strategic service vision based on ITSM processes, identify the Security KPIs in the case study, and create a comprehensive chart visualizing the data tracked for each KPI.

---

## Executive Summary & Case Background

* **Organization**: **TeleMarketeers** (A 10-year established BPO company delivering local chat and voice support for Internet Service Providers).
* **Security Units**:
  * **Network Team**: Dedicated to network infrastructure and internet connectivity.
  * **Firewall Team**: Responsible for traffic filtering and perimeter firewall activity monitoring.
  * **IT Desktop Support**: Handles initial tier-1 hardware/software endpoint issues.
  * **Blue Team**: Formulates overarching cybersecurity defense strategies and controls.
  * **Fast Attack Team**: Newly established elite white-hat security unit specifically targeting malware/spyware threats.
* **The Incident**: 
  On a single business day, 20 agent terminals experienced severe degradation (freezing, crashes, compromised credentials, random keystrokes). Initially misclassified as routine desktop glitches, the event escalated into a high-severity spyware attack originating from a compromised server. The Fast Attack team deployed newly configured anti-malware systems scaled for over 100 systems, collaborated across departments, and eradicated the threat in 3 hours.

## Section 1: Identification and Breakdown of Security KPIs

Based on **ITIL / ITSM Information Security Management** guidelines (specifically *IT2312 Handout 04*), six (6) essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are identified and tracked in the TeleMarketeers case study:

### 1. KPI 1: Number of Implemented Preventative Measures
* **Definition**: Charts the number of security measures and controls implemented based on perceived vulnerabilities or past intrusion attempts.
* **Case Study Evidence**: TeleMarketeers instituted multiple defensive layers:
  1. *Perimeter Network Traffic Monitoring* (Network Team).
  2. *Firewall Rule Management & Access Controls* (Firewall Team).
  3. *Blue Team Threat Strategy Formulation*.
  4. *Establishment of the "Fast Attack" Malware Response Unit*.
  5. *Procurement of Specialized Malware Hardware & Diagnostic Software*.
  6. *Deployment of Enterprise Scaled Anti-Malware System (>100 nodes)*.
  7. *Cross-Functional Collaboration Protocol (Fast Attack + Network + Firewall)*.
  8. *Server Isolation & Clean-Wipe Protocol*.
* **Total Tracked Information**: **8 Implemented Preventative Measures**.

---

### 2. KPI 2: Implementation Duration
* **Definition**: Measures the elapsed time from when a confirmed security concern is identified to the point where an effective resolution is fully deployed and verified.
* **Case Study Evidence**:
  * *Triage to Diagnosis*: Initial reports at 10:00 AM; spyware diagnosed by 1:00 PM (3 hours).
  * *Active Remediation*: Once the affected server was pinpointed, the team wiped the malware completely in **3 hours** (1:00 PM to 4:00 PM).
  * *Total Incident Lifecycle*: **6 hours** (10:00 AM to 4:00 PM).
* **Total Tracked Information**: **3 Hours Active Implementation Duration** (and **6 Hours Total Incident Lifecycle Duration**).

---

### 3. KPI 3: Number of High-Risk Security Incidents
* **Definition**: Tracks and classifies security incidents by severity level to ensure high-impact threats that endanger organizational operations are prioritized immediately.
* **Case Study Evidence**: 
  The event was initially misclassified as a low-risk desktop anomaly. However, the manifestation of credential theft, locked user accounts, keylogging (unauthorized keystrokes), and unauthorized browsing activity across 20 mission-critical agent stations formally classified it as a **High-Risk Security Incident** (Tier 1 Critical Threat).
* **Total Tracked Information**: **1 High-Risk Security Incident** (affecting 20 agent nodes and 1 central server).

---

### 4. KPI 4: Number of Security-Related Downtimes
* **Definition**: Quantifies service outages and operational downtime directly caused by security breaches, detailing affected operations, duration, and root causes.
* **Case Study Evidence**:
  * *Operational Disruption*: 20 BPO chat and call support agents were entirely unable to service ISP customers due to frozen machines, crashing applications, and locked credentials.
  * *Downtime Duration*: Approximately **6 hours** per affected terminal (10:00 AM to 4:00 PM), resulting in **120 cumulative agent-hours of lost customer service availability**.
* **Total Tracked Information**: **1 Major Security-Related Downtime Event** (20 workstations incapacitated).

---

### 5. KPI 5: Number of Security Tests
* **Definition**: Tracks proactive evaluations, trials, and simulated attacks conducted to audit existing security posture before real-world exploits occur.
* **Case Study Evidence**:
  The Fast Attack white-hat unit executed controlled internal assessment trials:
  1. *Test Run 1*: Small-scale evaluation conducted on **5 computer terminals**.
  2. *Test Run 2*: Scaled-up evaluation conducted on **20 computer terminals**.
* **Total Tracked Information**: **2 Proactive Security Tests**.

---

### 6. KPI 6: Number of Identified Shortcomings During Security Tests
* **Definition**: Documents, categorizes, and prioritizes vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and failures discovered during KPI 5 testing.
* **Case Study Evidence**:
  During the 20-workstation test run, three distinct technical shortcomings were recorded:
  1. *Resolution Latency*: Delays in the operational effectiveness of remediation scripts.
  2. *Throughput Degradation*: Slower system execution and progress under concurrent endpoint load.
  3. *Data Integrity Failure*: Complete corruption of local files during disinfection routines.
* **Total Tracked Information**: **3 Identified Shortcomings**.

```

### Strategic Service Recommendations for TeleMarketeers

1. **Implement Automated Event Management & Triage Protocols**:
   The initial delay between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM occurred because tier-1 desktop support treated widespread concurrent machine freezes as independent, low-risk issues. TeleMarketeers must implement an **AIOps or Event Correlation Engine** that automatically triggers high-risk alerts when identical symptoms occur across multiple endpoints simultaneously.

2. **Mandate Pre-Deployment Scalability Thresholds**:
   Because the Fast Attack team’s second trial (on 20 machines) exposed latency and file corruption, security tools must undergo strict automated stress testing. Tools must be certified for enterprise-wide scalability before being introduced into production networks.

3. **Institutionalize Cross-Functional Collaboration**:
   The rapid 3-hour eradication was achieved solely because the Fast Attack, Firewall, and Network teams collaborated as a unified unit. TeleMarketeers should formalize this structure into an ongoing **Cyber Defense Operations Center (CDOC)** aligned with the ITIL Practice of Information Security Management.
